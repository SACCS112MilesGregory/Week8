1. A Java class is a blueprint that is used to create objects, and to define object
   data types and methods. Classes are categories, and objects are items with each
   category. A class declaraton is made up of the following parts:

   * Modifiers
   * Class name
   * Keywords
   * Class body within curly brackets

2. Declaring a variable makes it available for use and instantiating a variable is the process of creating an instance of a class which represents the blueprint.
